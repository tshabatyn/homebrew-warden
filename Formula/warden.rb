    <<~EOS
      Warden manages a set of global services on the docker host machine. You
      will need to have Docker installed and docker-compose available in your
      local $PATH configuration prior to starting Warden.

      To start warden simply run:

        warden svc up

      This command will automatically run "warden install" to setup a trusted
      local root certificate and sign an SSL certificate for use by services
      managed by warden via the "warden sign-certificate warden.test" command.

      To print a complete list of available commands simply run "warden" without
      any arguments.
